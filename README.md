  # Tossinger 🎯
  
  **Toss first, think later.**
  
  Tossinger is a native iOS and macOS app that lets you quickly "toss" content from anywhere - tweets, web pages, articles, links - into your personal collection to revisit and organize later on your preferred device.

* **Quick Toss**: Save URLs or text from anywhere with a simple share action
* **Cross-platform**: Toss on your iPhone, organize on your MacBook (or vice versa)
* **Private**: Your tosses stay yours - no third-party cloud bullshit, just your own iCloud sync
* **Minimalistic**: No extra features, just you and your tosses, I hate bloated software
* **Biometrics lock**: Lock with device biometrics if you want

## How it works

1. **See something interesting?** Hit share → Tossinger
2. **Pick it up later** on any of your devices
4. **Organize** when you have time and headspace

## Privacy first

* **No accounts required** - just download and start tossing
* **CloudKit sync** - your data syncs through your iCloud, I never see it
* **Zero tracking** - no analytics, no hidden accounts, no bullshit

## Perfect for

* Saving tweets for later reading
* Bookmarking articles while commuting
* Collecting research links on mobile, organizing on desktop
* Building reading lists across devices
* Keeping track of random interesting shit you find online

---

*Stop losing track of the good stuff. Start tossing.*
