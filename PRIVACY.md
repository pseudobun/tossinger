# Privacy Policy for Tossinger

**Last Updated: February 3, 2026**

## Overview

Tossinger is built with privacy as a core principle. This privacy policy explains how your data is handled when you use Tossinger.

## Data Collection

**We don't collect, store, or have access to any of your data.**

Tossinger does not:
- Collect personal information
- Track your activity
- Store data on external servers
- Share data with third parties
- Use analytics or tracking services
- Display advertisements

## Data Storage and Sync

### Local Storage
All content you save in Tossinger ("tosses") is stored locally on your device using SwiftData.

### iCloud Sync
If you choose to enable iCloud sync:
- Your tosses are synced to your personal iCloud account using CloudKit
- Data is transmitted directly between your devices and Apple's iCloud servers
- We never have access to your iCloud data
- Apple's iCloud privacy policy applies to data stored in your iCloud account

### Share Extension
When you use the iOS share extension to save content:
- Data is shared between the extension and main app using App Groups (a secure iOS mechanism)
- All data remains on your device or your personal iCloud account
- No data is sent to external servers

## Biometric Authentication

If you enable biometric authentication (Face ID, Touch ID, or Optic ID):
- Biometric data never leaves your device
- Authentication is handled entirely by iOS/macOS
- We don't store or have access to your biometric information
- This feature uses Apple's LocalAuthentication framework

## Metadata Fetching

When you save a link, Tossinger may fetch publicly available metadata (title, description, preview images) from:
- YouTube (using YouTube's public oEmbed API)
- X/Twitter (using Twitter's public oEmbed API)
- Generic websites (by reading public HTML meta tags)

This fetching:
- Only occurs for links you explicitly save
- Uses publicly available APIs and data
- Does not transmit any personal information
- Does not track or log your activity

## Open Source
